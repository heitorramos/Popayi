## Introduction

- Transportation Mode Detection (TMD) involves classifying mobility traces to identify the corresponding transport mode. It can provide valuable insights into the mobility preferences, aiding in epidemic prevention, traffic management, and improving quality of life

- Most TMD literature relies on hand-crafted features (reaching hundreds of features) or computationally- and data-intensive DL methods, which pose challenges for resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios

- We present POPAyI, an innovative strategy based on Ordinal Pattern (OP) transformation applied to mobility-related time series that is computationally efficient, scalable, and provides accurate transportation mode detection.

## Ordinal Patterns

A symbolic representation of time series dynamics, capturing intrinsic features without relying on predefined models or heavy computational resources. It needs two parameters:

- Embedding dimension $D \in \mathbb{N}$ to determine the length of the patterns

- Embedding delay $\tau \in \mathbb N$ to define the interval between consecutive data points

## Ordinal Patterns

### A lightweight solution well-suited for edge computing applications, enabling on-device analytics while preserving privacy {.alert }

## Ordinal Patterns
![](img/ordinal_patterns.pdf){#op fig-align="center"}


## Ordinal Patterns Limitations

Traditional OPs face limitations when dealing with multidimensional data (e.g., mobility)

1. Absence of amplitude information
  - Be invariant to non-linear monotonic transformation is helpful against noise, but it can be harmful when amplitude contains essential information

  - Previous studies have incorporated amplitude into features extracted from OP, but its application to other OP features and representations remains limited

2. Originally defined for univariate time series
   - Previous studies have attempted to extend OP to multivariate data, but faced limitations such as increased computational complexity or loss of interpretability


## Ordinal Patterns Limitations

![](img/opLimitations.pdf){#opL fig-align="center"}

## Our approach: PoPayI

POPAyI (Polar Ordinal Patterns with Amplitude Information) is the first work to leverage amplitude information in a multivariate OP approach.

### How POPAyI works?

1. Converts 2D spatial data into symbolic patterns based on ordinal relationships between points

2. Uses polar coordinates to handle 2D mobility data (latitude and longitude)

3. Introduces amplitude information to distinguish variations in movement magnitude (e.g., slow vs. fast-moving vehicles)

## How POPAyI works?

![](img/popayi.pdf){#popayi fig-align="center"}

## Methodology

A) Data Preprocessing:
  - Segmentation: Trajectories are divided into segments based on stationary points or the end of the trajectory
  - Data Handling: Removal of low-quality data, such as out-of-range GPS points and trajectories with fewer than 10 points.


## Methodology 

B) POPAyI Transformation:

  - Ordinal Pattern Transformation: Converts time series into ordinal patterns using a sliding window.
  - Polar Coordinates: Patterns are based on the angle and distance of 2D points, capturing non-linear movement dynamics.
  - Amplitude Information: Calculates the displacement (distance) between the first and last points in the window, allowing for better distinction between movement types (e.g., slow vs. fast)
  
<!-- ## Methodology 

![](img/methodology.png){#popayiM1 fig-align="center"} -->

## Methodology

C) Representations Derived from POPAyI:
  - Probability Distribution: counts the occurrences of each ordinal pattern
    - Used to compute features like Shannon Permutation Entropy (PE), which measures the randomness of the time series, and Statistical Complexity (SC), which quantifies the level of structure in the data
  - Transition Network: A graph representation where nodes represent ordinal patterns, and edges represent transitions between patterns
    - Extract features such as Probability of Self-Transition (how likely a pattern repeats itself), Number of Nodes and Edges, and Average Edge Weights, indicating how dynamic or stable the movement is

<!-- ## Methodology

![](img/methodology2.png){#popayiM2 fig-align="center"} -->

## Methodology

D) Feature Extraction:
  - Features extracted from both the Probability Distribution (e.g., PE, SC) and the Transition Network (e.g., node/edge counts, self-transitions)
  - Additional statistical features from the mobility data itself, such as mean, variance, max, and min values for distance and speed
E) Classification:
  - Features are fed into an XGBoost classifier

### Transportation Mode Detection

**Goals:** 

:::{.nonincremental}
  - Predict the transportation mode based on spatiotemporal trajectory data.
  - Evaluate the effectiveness of POPAyI in classifying different transportation modes.
  - Compare POPAyI to state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods.

## Experiments 

### Transportation Mode Detection

**Setup:**

:::{.nonincremental}
  - We used GeoLife dataset, which contains 182 users' GPS trajectories over 5 years and various transportation modes: walking, biking, car, bus, subway, train.
  - Fixed-length segments of 500 points to ensure comparability across all models
  - Classification using cross-validation with 5 folds and stratified classes
::: 

## Experiments

### Hyperparameters selection

:::{.nonincremental}

- Explored values:
  - Embedding Dimension: D = 3, 4, 5
  - Embedding Delay: τ = 1, 2
  - Amplitude Threshold: q = 0.0005 to 3 (0.5 m to 3 km)
- Selection Process:
  - Used Successive Halving: progressively eliminated weaker configurations based on F1-score
  - $\tau$ = 2 consistently achieving the best results suggests that non-consecutive points capture more meaningful transport dynamics
  - Difficulty of establishing a straightforward correlation between hyperparameter values
:::

### Final choice: D = 3, τ = 2, q = 0.0005 {.alert}

### Transportation Mode Detection - POPAyI vs. 1D OP and POP

### 1D OP:
:::{.nonincremental}

  - Separates feature extraction for latitude and longitude.
  - Captures ordinal relationships in 1D space but misses non-linear movement dynamics in 2D mobility data.
:::
### POP:
:::{.nonincremental}

  - Polar Ordinal Patterns (POP) use polar coordinates to represent 2D spatial relationships.
  - Better suited to capturing complex movement behaviors like turns and changes in direction.
:::
### POPAyI:

:::{.nonincremental}
  - Incorporates amplitude information into POP, capturing both direction and magnitude of movement (e.g., speed changes).
